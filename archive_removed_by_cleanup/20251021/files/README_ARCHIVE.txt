The following binary/sample files were detected but not copied into the archive because they are binary (PDF) or large. They are listed here so you can move them manually or tell me to remove them.

files/paper1.pdf
files/paper2.pdf
files/paper3.pdf
files/slides1.pdf
files/slides2.pdf
files/slides3.pdf

If you want them moved into the archive directory, I can do that (they will still be present in git history).
